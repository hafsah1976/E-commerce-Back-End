# E-Commerce Backend (using Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) for SQL Database)

## Description

In the world of Internet, online shopping and owning online businesses is a trend. This is an E-Commerce Backend built using Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) for SQL Database. It is a server-side application that powers the functionality of an online store. A few learning points for me were:

1. **Object-Relational Mapping (ORM):** Developing an E-Commerce Backend using ORM for SQL Database involves learning how to map object-oriented models to relational database tables. This enables developers to interact with the database using high-level programming languages like JavaScript.

2. **Database Design:** Understanding how to design an efficient and scalable database schema is crucial. It includes creating tables for products, categories, and tags, and managing relationships between them.

3. **Inventory Management:** Learning how to track and manage product inventory, including updating stock levels when orders are placed and handling out-of-stock situations.

**Problem this project should solve:**

The E-Commerce Backend using ORM for SQL Database addresses the following problems:

1. **Online Store Functionality:** It provides the necessary backend functionality to build and operate an online store, allowing businesses to sell products and services over the internet.

2. **Scalability:** It enables businesses to scale their operations as they grow, handling a large number of products, users, and orders efficiently.

3. **Data Integrity:** By using an SQL database, it ensures data integrity and consistency, which is crucial for managing product information, user accounts, and financial transactions.

4. **Security:** It implements security measures to protect user data, payment information, and prevent unauthorized access to the system.

5. **User Experience:** It contributes to a seamless and user-friendly shopping experience by managing shopping carts, order histories, and providing secure payment options.

6. **Inventory Management:** It assists in keeping track of product availability and automates inventory updates as orders are placed.
